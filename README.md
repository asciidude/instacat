# InstaCat
InstaCat is an Instagram chatbot that sends images of cats when "cat" is detected in DMs.

Due to the lack of flexibility in terms of events with InstagrAPI, I had to implement my own "event handler" that detects incoming messages within a range of Â±10 seconds. This system works fine and the bot will only handle one message at a time, with an additional sleep method being called every 2 1/2 seconds to ensure the Inbox API is not being spammed.

Honestly, this project was extremely tedious to work with and took a total of 3 hours and 45 minutes to complete. Even now, I am not sure if it will properly handle *all* errors, but regardless I'm not going to continue working on this. It's entire intention was a silly project, and that it did well.

#### You should run this program on a quality, not shared proxy and use a different account for Instagram. If you are using your own computer, run this with a VPN to avoid blacklist.

## Dependencies
- instagrapi
- RedDownloader

## Logging in
In your main.py file, change "username" and "password" to your username and password for Instagram.

## Enabling/Disabling Downloads
To enable/disable image downloads (eg. if you're simply restarting or do daily restarts) you can change the `downloading` variable to "disabled". To re-enable it, change it to `False`. This will download 5 images from r/cat. You can change this but RedDownloader does *not* work well over 5-10 image downloads.

**It is automatically disabled by default.** It is kind of slow and you should probably opt for just adding your own images to a `downloaded` directory within your project folder.
